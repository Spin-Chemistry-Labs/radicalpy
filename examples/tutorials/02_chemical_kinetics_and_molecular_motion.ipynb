        "The below reaction scheme depicts the usual fates during a transient radical pair reaction in solution. Radical pairs are short-lived intermediates produced via electron transfer, decomposition, or hydrogen transfer reactions from <font color='orange'>S-</font> (<font color='orange'>singlet</font>) or <font color='purple'>T-</font> (<font color='purple'>triplet</font>) precursors, where reactions occuring from <font color='blue'>free radicals</font> and its precursors are called F-precursors. The dynamic behaviour of radical pairs produced from <font color='purple'>T-</font> and F-precursors are similar in nature, producing similar reaction results. A radical pair is generated while surrounded by solvent molecules, known as \"[solvent cages or cage effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_effect)\" and preserves the spin multiplicity of its precursor (*i.e.*, <font color='orange'>singlet</font> or <font color='purple'>triplet</font>). The two radicals are produced in close proximity and are known as \"close pairs\", which can recombine to the ground state to produce \"cage products\" through <font color='orange'>S-</font>close pairs immediately after radical pair formation (primary recombination).\n",
        "\n",
        "Close pairs containing light atom-centred radicals (*e.g.*, C-, N-, and O-) do not undergo <font color='orange'>S</font><font color='purple'>T</font>-mixing due to the large exchange interaction. However, if the close pairs possess heavy atom-centred radicals (*e.g.*, S-, P-, Si-, Ge-, and Sn-), <font color='orange'>S</font><font color='purple'>T</font>-mixing is possible through spin-orbit coupling ([SOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93orbit_interaction)). This tutorial will only concern itself with light atom-centred radicals. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's consider the case when the close pairs start to diffuse (typical diffusive steps $10^{-12}$ $s^{-1}$) apart into a \"separated RP or separated pair\". When the distance ($r$) between the two radicals is sufficiently large, the exchange interaction ($J$) is removed (or negligibly small) and <font color='orange'>S</font><font color='purple'>T</font>-mixing can occur. Some separated pairs re-encounter to form close pairs, subsequently recombining to the ground state. However, other separated pairs escape their solvent cage to form free radicals. One can see from the below figures that the timescales for secondary recombination and <font color='orange'>S</font><font color='purple'>T</font>-mixing are comparable, therefore, a change in <font color='orange'>S</font><font color='purple'>T</font>-mixing (caused by an external magnetic field and/or differences in hyperfine couplings) can alter the yield of cage and escape products.\n",

However, if the RPs are confined in some way long-lived radical pairs of >>10 ns are observed and consequently the magnetic field effect (MFE) becomes larger. Typical reaction environments, where the RPs are encapsulated or confined, also known as chemical cages are micelles, reverse micelles, vesicles, ionic liquids, and proteins. In non-viscous solvents, electron [spin-lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93lattice_relaxation) ($T_1$) and [spin-spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93spin_relaxation) ($T_2$) relaxation (simply put, a non-equilibrium state (*e.g.*, radical pair) returns to its equilibrium state) is on the timescale of $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-4}$ s and $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-5}$ s, respectively. Therefore, spin relaxation does not usually influence magnetic field effects in non-viscous solvents.\n",

Where $0^\\circ \\leq \\theta \\leq 180^\\circ (\\pi \\,rad)$ and $0^\\circ \\leq \\varphi \\leq 360^\\circ (2\\pi \\,rad)$, which can be written in code as `theta = np.pi * np.random.rand()` and `phi = 2 * np.pi * np.random.rand()`, respectively.\n",

In the parentheses following the function name you can see our variables `n_step, r_min, r_max, ...`, which we specify outside of the function and input when we call the function in our code. In the code below, we used the function as follows, `radA_x, radA_y, radA_z, dist, angle = randomwalk3D(n, r_min, r_max, x_0, y_0, z_0, Dab, deltaT)`. From this function, we can obtain the $x, y, z$ coordinates (`radA_x, radA_y, radA_z`), the distance between radical A and radical B (`dist`), and the angle $\\theta$ (`angle`) at each step of the Monte Carlo random walk simulation. We will use the values from `dist` and `angle` for calculating *J*- and *D*-couplings later in the tutorial. The distance is between two points in three dimensions is given by,\n",
